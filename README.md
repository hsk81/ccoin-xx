ccoin++
=======

A C++ clone of [picocoin](https://github.com/jgarzik/picocoin) - a `tiny
bitcoin library, with lightweight client and utils`. To understand it in
detail and grasp the intricacies of the bitcoin protocol I decided to port
the library from C to C++.

I'm not a C expert at all, and my C++ is a little rusty, therefore the learning
process involved will slow the porting down. Still once accomplished I hope to
be able to rewrite it (again) in Python, provide a Python C extension or come
up with my own extensions/applications for this new exciting technology.
